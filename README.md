Simple CSS Cat Painting

This project is a simple CSS cat painting created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course
In this mini-project, I practiced:

-Absolute positioning to place elements precisely
-z-index to layer parts of the cat correctly
-Transform property to rotate and shape elements
